\section{Implementation}

\begin{comment}
	\emph{EE:}
	We've two implementations.
	(implementation strategy) having two codebases using two different languages: - confidence that each implementation was correct - ability to work concurrently and with individual time constraints.
	cons: increased debuging time: Debug both in isolation, then debug their communication.
	We overshot (debugging in isolation is our current status). took much time to debug what was going wrong and we ended up with two buggy codebases. (The ML code is complete. The C code is incomplete. Both have bugs in isolation. We've yet to reach integration bugs.)
	
	!!!Things are broken!!!
