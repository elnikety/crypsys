\section{Contributions}

This appendix describes the efforts done jointly and individually by the team
members.

Elnikety: Eslam worked on defining the problem. He read related work in trusted
computing, trying to pin down which capabilities a system can provid when
integrated with a secure cryptocard. He helped writing the proposal of the
project. Later, during the implementation, he was working on the cryptoside DAA
prover code. He helped writing this report.

Kapcari: Edit helped defining the problem. She investigated the available
capabilities for TPM on Linux machines. She presented our proposal to the class.
During the implementation, she was working on the network communication between
the issuer, the prover, and the verifier.

Rajani: Vineet helped defining the problem. During the implementation, he
initiated the efforts on accessing the cryptocard and investigated how to
compile and deploy custom-build binary images on the cryptocard. He was working
on the cryptocard DAA prover code.

Swasey: David helped defining the problem. He surveyed the literature trying to
understand attestation protocols in particular. He helped writing the proposal
of the poject. He identified the set of algorithms and procedures underlying
DAA. He provided full implementation in ML for the different roles within
the system. He helped writing this report
