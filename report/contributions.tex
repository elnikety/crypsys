\section{Contributions}

We describe the work we have done, jointly and individually.

Elnikety: Eslam helped define the problem. He read related work in trusted
computing, trying to pin down which capabilities a system can provide when
integrated with a secure cryptocard. He helped write our project proposal.
Later, during the implementation, he worked on the cryptocard DAA
code. He helped write this report.

Kapcari: Edit helped define the problem. She investigated the available
capabilities for TPM on Linux machines. She presented our proposal to the class.
During the implementation, she worked on the network communication between
the issuer, the cryptocard, and the verifier.

Rajani: Vineet helped define the problem. During the implementation, he investigated access to
the cryptocard and how to compile, deploy, and communicate with
custom-built binary images on the cryptocard. He worked
on the cryptocard DAA code.

Swasey: David helped define the problem. He read related work on
trusted computing, IBM cryptocards, and zero-knowledge proofs. He helped write our project proposal.
He explained DAA to the group.
He implemented the full DAA protocol in ML.
He helped write this report.
